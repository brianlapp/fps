# Free Parent Search - UI Showcase

This is a simplified UI showcase for the Free Parent Search application, designed to demonstrate the responsive, high-impact hero unit and other key UI elements to your team. This showcase is specifically created for deployment on Netlify to give your team a visual representation of your UI work.

## Purpose

This UI showcase serves as a demonstration of your UI updates, particularly focusing on the responsive hero unit. Since your team can't see your local development environment, this Netlify deployment will allow you to effectively showcase your work and potentially gain access to the production repository.

## Features Showcased

- **Responsive Hero Unit** with gradient text, animations, and feature links
- **Main Grid Layout** with activity generator and article search
- **Featured Articles Section** with trending content
- **Category Browsing** with visual cards
- **Featured Article Highlight** with author information
- **About Section** with gradient heading and testimonial

## Technical Details

## Notes
